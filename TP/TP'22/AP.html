                Fiji falls in tropical part of this planet what means it has a huge exposure of Solar energy. It is a good source of bio-gas either due to having large animal industries</p>

   	<h2> Solution <i id="ps" class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2> 

		<p>For electricity issues <u> <b>Solar and Bio-gas</b> </u> energy should be first target. In general Fiji gets a good intensity of sunlight
		   throughout the year which would facilitate more production towards Solar Electricity. As pig waste is benificial in bio-gas production
		   this might act as a raw matirial in bio-gas plant to make bio-gas from it what can be supplied to local houses for cooking purposes.Moreover, a bio-gas plat can 
		   convert bio-gas into electricity which can be used  to power a whole village by building a solar-biogas <u>hybrid grid</u>
		</p>

		<p>Building hybrid grid across villages electricity scarcity can certainly be brought down to minimum. This hybrid grid will work on both solar and bio-gas prodused 
		   electricity. This hybrid energy supply would be enough to shine a village during dark. In addition, <u>Local radio stations</u>, upon Solar PV installation would be able to charge their 
                   radio phones and play as a <u>solar operated station</u> what can provide electricity to its surrounding houses. Having solar power radio communication will be robust and consistant.
		</p>

		<p>Last but not least building a <b> <u>De-central water system </u> </b>can resolve drinking water supply in villages when villagers are facing lack of water during dry season or emergency</p>

	<h3>Solution for Electricity <i id="ps" class="fa fa-plug"aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
		<p>Way to Solar and hybrid erergy :</p> 
		
		<p>Portable solar power plant and hybrid solar system do already exist in Nadi town and Teveuni island [hybrid solar system & off grid system].Now 
		what is neede on top of it is an approach where more than one energy sourse can be hybridised. It is a hybrid grid because it will work on hybrid mode consisting energy from sun and bio-gas.
		When there is a scarcity of solar energy bio-gas can substitute the rest and vice-vars.	For example, this solar-biogas hybrid grid will be an result of collaboration of solar and biogas energy outcomes. It would not just bring more power but also more utilisation of green energy.
		Hence hybrid grid powered by both Solar and Bio gas energy can certainly be a robust arrangement Fiji government can implement to tockle power cut and bring electricity to rural areas never got white light in dark. 
		</p>	
		<p>
		Another fold of Solar energy would be to power up the radio stations what play as a mean for distant-communication. Installing Solar PV
		can provide sufficient energy to operate the communication non-stop alongside lighting up the station after dark. 
		</p>

	<h3>Solution for Water supply <i id="ps" class="fa fa-tint" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3> 
		<p>De-centralised water system
		
		A water system that would be able to feed a whole village.
		At first some wells need to be chosen which are at the mid way from the center of a village to its end. Thses wells will play as a key role in both
		daily supply and storage for emergency supply. Each well would be build as a water station powered by hybrid grid or atleast solar grid.
		Pumps will be there to bring water to the storahe attached to the well so that in dry season when villagrs cannot find water level by hand, storage tank 
		would supply the same.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		After this a huge water resorvour should be made in the heart ofa village which would be a storage fillied by the access water coming from the water 
		stations made previously so that decent amount of water can be provided in time of scarcity.
