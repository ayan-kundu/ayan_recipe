                <p id='justify-text'>One of the main challenges Fiji is recently facing is energy crisis.
                Fiji falls in tropical part of this planet what means it has a huge exposure of Solar energy. It is a good source of bio-gas either due to having large animal industries</p>

		<h2> Some Facts over Fiji energy and water system</h2>
                <p id='justify-text'>Pig industry in Fiji is highly successful what has shown positive growth in recent years capturing 80% of the countryâ€™s pork market and ensuring food security. Obviously, pig waste is readily enormous that becomes a key towards bio-gas production and boosting crop-field fertility.</p> 
                <p id='justify-text'>It is reported that 12% percent of Fijians do not have access to clean drinking water. Villagers significantly struggle finding drinking water during dry seasons as they either rely on well or public water bodies.</p>

                <h2>Problem statement:</h2>
// make a triange of 3 headlines// restate and conside the sentences
                <p>Lack of energy utilisation plan to Fiji's huge renewable power sources. No all villages have electricity. Moreover power cut is usual in Fiji.</p>

                <p>Communication between villages and even inside a village people rely on radio signal. Villages lack robust radio communication station.</p>

                <p>Poor water system in villages. There is no central water supply to provide sufficient drinking water to villagers.<p>

   		<h2> Solution </h2>

<p>For electricity issues Solar and Bio-gas energy should be first target.</p>

<p>Building hybrid grid across villages electricity scarcity can be brought down to minimum. Solar power operated radio stations can solve poor intra and inter-villages radio communication.

Last but not least building a central water system can resolve drinking water supply in villages</p>
<h3>Solution for Electricity </h3>
<p>Solar erergy</p>
<p>portable solar power plant and hybrid solar system do already exist in Nadi town and Teveuni island [hybrid solar system & off grid system] Hybrid grid:solar and bio gas hybridised energy powering grid system 
//images
Another fold of Solar energy would be to feed light up green spaces made near to the solar stations for recreation and fun visit.</p>
*Solar energy for communication improvement
Through off-grid solar system, each solar station will charge up the batteries that will provide backup during the night, and cloudy days. Part of the solar energy will be used for instant charging for solar panel-operated radio phones. There would be multiple phones obviously. #com issue improved!
**Application: Intra and inter-village communication, Alert communication for coastal areas.
**Environmentally: Lighting up the Green spaces around the stations
<p>Bio-gas from Pig-manure</p>

<h3>Solution for Water supply </h3>
<p>Centrally operated water system</p>
*Bio gas for local energy supply specially for water system.
For example A water system for a village giving water to houses as a group living near to each other. The power derived from Bio gas will be employed to drive the water system. We can make few water stations in a village where people can go and have fresh drinking water.

Communication improvement via green energy
As a part of renewable energy we can make solar stations powering up com stations to spread emergency news across koro(s) or locally.[Design part]
Therefore, Solar power operated communication will facilitate radio communication consistent.

<div id="container2">
<h2 id='container2-heading'> Outcome </h2>
	<ol class='outcome'>
<li >
Robust solar-radio communication which would be continous connecting villages with each other. More convinient communication across different parts in a village</li>
<li>
Pig-manure wopuld be used to produce bio-gas transforming into green energy</li>
<li>
Hybrid grid operated by solar and bio-gas will provide electricity at constant mode. Villages never got electricity, would be shining at dark now on</li>
<li>
Centrally operated water system will put an end to water scarcity during dry season</li>
<li>
Green spaces lit up by solar energy would play as an amusement for adults and children extending Fijian beauty further.</li>
