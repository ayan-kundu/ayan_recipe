                <p id='justify-text'>One of the main challenges Fiji is recently facing is energy crisis.
                Fiji falls in tropical part of this planet what means it has a huge exposure of Solar energy. It is a good source of bio-gas either due to having large animal industries</p>

	<h2> Electricity and Water supply in Fiji </h2>
                <p id='justify-text'>Geographically, Fiji falls under tropical region on earth waht makes it a huge reservour of solar energy. Beside this having the biggiest as Pig Industry, pig waste is enormous in herewhat might lead to bio-gas production leading to boost up Fiji's green energy availibility prospect</p> 
                <p id='justify-text'>It is reported that 12% percent of Fijians do not have access to clean drinking water. Villagers significantly struggle finding drinking water during dry seasons as they either rely on well or public water bodies.</p>

   	<h2> Solution </h2>

		<p>For electricity issues <u> <b>Solar and Bio-gas</b> </u> energy should be first target. In general Fiji gets a good intensity of sunlight
		   throughout the year which would facilitate more production towards Solar Electricity. As pig waste is benificial in bio-gas production
		   this might act as a raw matirial in bio-gas plant to make bio-gas from it what can be supplied to local houses for cooking purposes.Moreover, a bio-gas plat can 
		   convert bio-gas into electricity which can be used  to power a whole village by building a solar-biogas <u>hybrid grid</u>
		</p>

		<p>Building hybrid grid across villages electricity scarcity can certainly be brought down to minimum. This hybrid grid will work on both solar and bio-gas prodused 
		   electricity. This hybrid energy supply would be enough to shine a village during dark. In addition, <u>Local radio stations</u>, upon Solar PV installation would be able to charge their 
                   radio phones and play as a <u>solar operated station</u> what can provide electricity to its surrounding houses. Having solar power radio communication will be robust and consistant.
		</p>

		<p>Last but not least building a <b> <u>De-central water system </u> </b>can resolve drinking water supply in villages when villagers are facing lack of water during dry season or emergency</p>

	<h3>Solution for Electricity </h3>
		<p>Solar erergy</p>
		<p>portable solar power plant and hybrid solar system do already exist in Nadi town and Teveuni island [hybrid solar system & off grid system] Hybrid grid:solar and bio gas hybridised energy powering grid system 
//images
		Another fold of Solar energy would be to feed light up green spaces made near to the solar stations for recreation and fun visit.</p>
		*Solar energy for communication improvement
		Through off-grid solar system, each solar station will charge up the batteries that will provide backup during the night, and cloudy days. Part of the solar energy will be used for instant charging for solar panel-operated radio phones. There would be multiple phones obviously. #com issue improved!
		**Application: Intra and inter-village communication, Alert communication for coastal areas.
		**Environmentally: Lighting up the Green spaces around the stations
		<p>Bio-gas from Pig-manure</p>

	<h3>Solution for Water supply </h3>
		<p>Centrally operated water system</p>
		*Bio gas for local energy supply specially for water system.
		For example A water system for a village giving water to houses as a group living near to each other. The power derived from Bio gas will be employed to drive the water system. We can make few water stations in a village where people can go and have fresh drinking water.

		Communication improvement via green energy
		As a part of renewable energy we can make solar stations powering up com stations to spread emergency news across koro(s) or locally.[Design part]
		Therefore, Solar power operated communication will facilitate radio communication consistent.

	<h2 id='container2-heading'> Outcome </h2>
	<ol class='outcome'>
		<li id='oc' >
		Robust solar-radio communication which would be continous connecting villages with each other. More convinient communication across different parts in a village</li>
		<li id='oc'>
		Pig-manure wopuld be used to produce bio-gas transforming into green energy</li>
		<li id='oc'>
		Hybrid grid operated by solar and bio-gas will provide electricity at constant mode. Villages never got electricity, would be shining at dark now on</li>
		<li id='oc'>
		Centrally operated water system will put an end to water scarcity during dry season</li>
		<li id='oc'>
		Green spaces lit up by solar energy would play as an amusement for adults and children extending Fijian beauty further.</li>
