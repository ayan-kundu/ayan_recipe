   Cooking is a great thing to enjoy if you like it and I am sure you are going to fall in love with it when you start to cook for none but for yourself being in university from your own house.
To be fair I did not use to cook for myself while I was in my country but after I drop in here I start cooking as I got to understand very precisely that I can't live on ready-made food sold in the shops although they are very good in taste and to have (if you don't consider your health that much).I brought utensils like pressure-cooker, frying pan, dishes and cups, so I did not have to buy many things for cooking. Morrison is a good place for buying cooking stuffs (my recommendation!).There are so many shops and supermarkets all around the city of Lincoln where one can find chocolate and spices to fruits and groceries. Few popular stations for this are Iceland ,Poundland ,M&S, Asian store(pop in here if you are a spice lover).I realized cooking can be a good option to do when you are feeling bored  as it not only fill your  tummy but also gives a feel of doing something great. What I really appreciate is that here in the UK the food are so fresh and preserved in a good atmosphere so that they are always handed over to customers with a good quality to eat and serve.

It was a quite new and funny experience I had on day one when I reached and started cooking lunch for breakfast! Fortunately, I made it good so I could eat(at-least good looking and tasty!).I gradually fall in love with cooking and now I can make several spicy, non-spicy dishes with veg, non-veg items . So, yah! I must say cooking in house is definitely a fun and good thing to get yourself engaged and away from boredom.
