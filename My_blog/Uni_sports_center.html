when for the first time I went inside sports center I got to the reception and then one of the receptionist got me tour of the whole sports center and the attractive new 
                facilities. He showed me the gym which was inside of it with a wide space for practice.
                I talked to some people doing some exercise and got to know that they are very satisfied 
                with their gym and its equipment. One gym trainer guide them thoroughly and help them in their daily workout routine.

During the month of April I participated in Netball event and football also lunch time walk which is organised collectively by sports center and university chaplaincy. Imade few friend while I was taking part in these events bagging good experience as well.It helped me learn cultural stuffs and all which definitely plays a good role towards international career.I joined Yoga and Dancing event online throughout the month of April and May and It gave me mental and physical strength along with a fresh attitude towards life transformation. University played a good role behind students' well-being continuously throughoutthe whole pandemic providing online yoga ,meditation, dance classes and so on.I personally believe these services are quite beneficial to overcome frustration due to constant lockdown and restrictions.
Overall, sports center and the programs provided by it are awesome to be linked in.The review of sports center is also good and so its facilities. Students are more than happy to enjoy many different events organised by the sports center and they are looking forward to join much more activities coming to them via their sports center.

It was a quite new and funny experience I had on day one when I reached and started cooking lunch for breakfast! Fortunately, I made it good so I could eat(at-least good looking and tasty!).I gradually fall in love with cooking and now I can make several spicy, non-spicy dishes with veg, non-veg items . So, yah! I must say cooking in house is definitely a fun and good thing to get yourself engaged and away from boredom.
