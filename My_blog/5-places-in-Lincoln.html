              <h3>
              Lincoln Castle:
              </h3>
              <p>
Lincoln Castle is situated on the top of the steep hill going up towards west from the university. So if one wants to reach; he has to pass through the wonderful High street lying in the middle of Lincoln. One can enjoy the castle wall walk in the evening which will give you a compact view of the whole city: Lincoln. Sometime at the front of this castle it happens to be Lincoln maker’s market which gives opportunity to buy and see wonderful things made by people at home along with Magna Carta quiz featuring prizes for participants, organised every Monday evening.

              <h3>
              Lincoln Cathedral:
              </h3>
              <p>Lincoln cathedral is one of the tallest Cathedrals here in the UK which is my most visited place here in Lincoln. It not only emits the history of this city but also it makes people astonished with its fine beauty. It has a statue of great poet “Alfred Tennyson” just behind it which adds more value to it. One can relax and enjoy time sitting in the greenery around the back of this cathedral.
              </p>
              <h3>
              Brayford pool:
              </h3>
              <p>
                Visiting Lincoln is incomplete without being in Brayford pool. This is certainly one of the best pool-areas here in Lincoln as well as Lincolnshire that I have been to. There is parking facility in Lucy tower car park. One can go for long walks along either side of the river into Lincoln town. One can eat at two following sites near to this pool: "Wagamama" & "Cosy Club". This Brayford pool has a island which is a habitat of Lincoln special swans and dozens of birds. This is a lovely part of Lincoln for sure that I fall in love after dropping down here in Lincoln. A good number of diverse restaurants and take away are there which adds extra value to it. Some boat trips are also now available to enjoy the summer light. This is definitely worth a visit, A great place to be in!

              <h3>
              South common:
              </h3>
              <p>In my view South Common is one of the most beautiful parks over here in Lincoln. Here, the natural habitats which include grassland and scrub and plantations, hosts a variety of wildlife. One can explore natural areas in it with a large scale variety of wildlife like one can see horses here interacting with its community. The South Common is a large area of common land that lies on the south eastern boundary of the city of Lincoln, where the High Street meets Newark Road and St. Catherine’s. One interesting thing about this place is that this place is easily seen as you go uphill and obviously from Lincoln castle.

              <h3>
              Lincoln Arboretum Park:
              </h3>
              <p>
                This is one of the kids' most favourite places to visit and a relaxing soothing place for adults' to be in. This public park has some beautiful ponds to sit by and spend time. It consists of a large variety of trees which makes this place calm and cool. It has a hedge maze, a children’s play area, a lion statue with two fountains features which are main attractions in it. This is definitely a good place to visit and have some nice memorable photographs.
